My name is Jonathan Lundquist. I am from Tacoma, WA, but currently live in Rexburg, ID as I attend Brigham Young University - Idaho full time. 
I have been married for about one year now, and my wife also attends BYU-I. I have been a history major for most of my career here at BYU-I,
but have recently switched to Web Design and Development, this is my first class in my new major!

I enjoy watching and playing football, <b>(Go Pats!)</b> I also enjoy cooking, reading, and tabletop games with my friends.
I am very excited to take this course, as I hope to eventually work in the web design industry after college, or anything in the programming industry really.
This is my first experience with HTML and so far I am enjoying it.

I have attended BYU-I full time for three years now, and really enjoy the school. I like that it is a smaller campus and college so professors have extra time
to work with their students so that we can all get a personalized experience. The subsidized tuition also helps me enjoy the school a little bit more <b>;)</b>
I look forward to learning with all of you as we move forward with this new experience this semester. Good luck everyone!
